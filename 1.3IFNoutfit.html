<h2>Timeless Melody</h2>
	<p>This dress came out with the imfamous eerie season update which was filled with fun events and mini games to play and added new gorgeous outfits like this one and the 4 star outfit. however this update got huge backlash for the deemed 'ugly' free outfits and the chinese comunity apsolutely butchering the gorgeous Timeless Melody dress for its slow attack speed and it's supposedly ugly colour schemes, what do you think? it was also released with around 3 free oufits that werent fan favourites due to one of them having a vest and glasses that didnt go with anything and another having an ugly dress but the accessories were favoured</p>
