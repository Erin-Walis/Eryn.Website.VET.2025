<h2>Wings of Wishes</h2>
	<p>This dress was one of the less popular ones, many people didnt like it however the thing that brought this update to its peak was the 4 star dresses. The 4 star dresses were stunning pieces for less that had gorgeous patterns on them, one looking more like a ballerina with pearl and shell detailing to promote the Ribbon fish event, while the othter was a goregous light blue with pearl and jewel detailing that makes it cuter than many others this was also a good time for pay to win players due to the cute 4 star that came out in the shop for people to buy with paid ingame currency. even if the 5 star outfit wasnt the spotlight, this update was one of the best.</p>
