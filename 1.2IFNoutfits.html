<h2>Dance till Dawn + Stardust Flare</h2>
	<p>These dresses came out with the imfamous firework isles, a whole new area on part of the map that allowed the player to collect 'Whimballoons' and gain a firework launcher, perfect to take photos with. This was also a crazy pay to win update due to the Chinese Lunar New Year which allowed players to buy cute outfits for nikkis little companion, Momo, and even a dress that lets you play a different instrument rather than just a violin. The publics view on these dresses were quite promising, the Dance Till Dawn dress getting most of the attention with the pigtails that people claimed to look like Hatsune Mikus and the stunning dress and accessories it came with. Stardust Flare was a bit controversial, some people adoring the accessories and hair, while others thinking its ugly and they shouldve given us more for the Lunar New Year.</p>
