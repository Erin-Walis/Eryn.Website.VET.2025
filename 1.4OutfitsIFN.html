<h2>Crimson Rapsody</h2>
	<p>This dress came out with some of the most Play to win items in the game which were stunning. Not only were the play to win items stunning but most found this main outfit to be gorgeous especially the cute hand held doll item, this dress certainly out shinned the previous one with many people finding the 1.3 dress to be ugly and the skill to be too long. However this one seemed to be one of the more favoured sets. Many people also favoured the doll and how cute and Lolita some of the recolours were. The accessories also had the cutes little details with them, with lots of hearts and bows being added to the mix it made it all a cute.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
