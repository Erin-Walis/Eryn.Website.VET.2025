	<p>These dresses sparked a bit of controversy in the comunity. People were so excited and thought the dresses were beautiful which they are, however there were 11 pieces of clothing in this set where usually there are only 9 pieces causing players needing to do 40 more pulls then you previously had to as if they were trying to get players to spend more money if the players didnt save and wanted the outfits. however these are still some of the most detailed dresses we have gotten in the game so far, looking absolutely stunning.</p>
